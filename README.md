Files contain verilog code to implement a music player on a DE1-SoC board. This music player has capability of reading memory contents, taking input from the keyboard to control the music player, and displaying sound intensity using the onboard LED's. 
Some of the main concepts used and learned were finite state machines, Start-Finish protocol, and working with memory.
